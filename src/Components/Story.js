                        The Little Lemon Restaurant is one of Chicagoâ€™s
                        best-kept secrets, nestled in a charming corner of the
                        city near bustling malls, thriving businesses, and
                        vibrant schools. Founded by Mario and Adrian, whose
                        passion for Mediterranean cuisine was ignited during an
                        inspiring journey to Portugal, they returned home
                        determined to bring the rich flavors, warmth, and
                        diversity of the Mediterranean to their Chicago
                        community through an authentic and masterfully crafted
                        dining experience.
